  "description": "Use these REST APIs for performing operations on NamedValue entity associated with your Azure API Management deployment. API Management policies are a powerful capability of the system that allow the publisher to change the behavior of the API through configuration. Policies are a collection of statements that are executed sequentially on the request or response of an API. Policy statements can be constructed using literal text values, policy expressions, and NamedValues. Each API Management service instance has a NamedValues collection of key/value pairs that are global to the service instance. These NamedValues can be used to manage constant string values across all API configuration and policies.",
