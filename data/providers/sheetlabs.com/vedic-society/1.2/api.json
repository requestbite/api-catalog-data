Proper nouns are not included (yet).\n\nThe API uses the Swagger 2.0 specification.\n\n# Authentication\nThis is an open API.\n\n# Try it out\nThis sandbox can be used to get data for only one kind of resource, that is, to fetch data for a string contained in the meaning of any of the words.\n\nThe remaining resources work a similar fashion.
