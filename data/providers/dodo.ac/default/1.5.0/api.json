  "description": "The Nookipedia API provides endpoints for retrieving *Animal Crossing* data pulled from the [Nookipedia wiki](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Main_Page). A couple of the key benefits of using the Nookipedia API is access to data spanning the entire *Animal Crossing* series, as well as information that is constantly updated and expanding as editors work on the wiki.\n\nAccess to the Nookipedia API requires obtaining a key. This is so we can manage our scale and provide better support for our users. To request access to the API, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/wLwtXLerKhfDrRLY8).\n\nThis API is 'version 2' of our [original API](https://nookipedia.com/api/). While the previous API scraped information directly from the wiki, this new edition of the API pulls data from a structured and constrained database, resulting in higher-quality data, better searching, and support for filtering.",
