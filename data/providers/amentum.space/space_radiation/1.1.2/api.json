  "name": "Space Radiation API",
  "description": "Space has a hostile radiation environment that increases the risk of cancers in humans and malfunctions in spacecraft electronics. The types of space  radiation of primary concern are:\n\n\n-\nGalactic Cosmic Rays from outside our solar system generated by\nsupernovae and other phenomena;\n\n\n-\nSolar Energetic Particles produced by the Sun during intense and\nsporadic bursts of activity; and\n\n\n-\nTrapped Radiation: energetic particles confined by Earth's magnetic\nfield, usually comprising an inner belt of mostly high energy protons\nand an outer belt dominated by lower energy electrons and plasma.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the space radiation environment for a particular mission profile is becoming increasingly important. Commercial off-the-shelf electronic components  that aren't resilient to space radiation are now prevalent. Longer duration  missions to cislunar space, Mars, and beyond are placing astronauts at greater  risk of radiation exposure.\n\nAPI requests must contain a key \"API-Key\" in the header (see code samples).
