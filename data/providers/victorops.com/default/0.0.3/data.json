Also, some of these API calls have rate limits.\n\nNOTE: In this documentation when creating a sample curl request (clicking the TRY IT OUT! button), in some API\nviewing interfaces, the '@' in an email address may be encoded. Please note that the REST endpoints will not\nprocess the encoded version. Make sure that the encoded character '%40' is changed to its unencoded form before\nsubmitting the curl request.",
