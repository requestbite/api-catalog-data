            The identifier of your application.

            This is the package name on Android and the bundle identifier on iOS.

            It is vital to use the correct value. If your service does not supply the correct value legitimate orders might
            be blocked.

            This is used to uniquely identify the device and should be a value that is not tied to a single user of the
            device. Preferably, it should remain the same even if your app is reinstalled.

        Additional data included when creating an order from your app.

        When starting an order from your app client this data may be included in the request.

        You can send the parameter `web` or `app`, not both. If providing this parameter, at least one of its members must
        be specified.
    endUserIp:
      type: string
      description: |-
        The user IP address as it is seen by your service.

        IPv4 and IPv6 are allowed.

        Make sure that the IP address you include as `endUserIp` is the address of your end user's device, not the internal
        address of any reverse proxy between you and the end user.

        In use cases where the IP address is not available, e. g. for voice-based services, the internal representation of
        those systems' IP address is ok to use.

        If this is set to `true` a risk indicator will be included in the collect response when the order completes.

      example: true
    returnUrl:
      maxLength: 512
      minLength: 1
      type: string
      description: |-
        Orders started on the same device as where the user's BankID is stored (started with autostart token) will call
        this URL when the order is completed.

        Any return URL provided in the start URL when the BankID app was launched will be ignored. If the user has a
        version of the BankID app that does not support getting the `returnUrl` from the server, the order will be
        cancelled and the user will be asked to update their app.

        The return URL you provide should include a nonce to the session. When the user returns to your app or web page,
        your service should verify that the order was completed successfully and that the device receiving the
        `returnUrl` is the same device that started the order.

        Using this parameter will make your service more secure and strengthen the channel binding between you and the
        user.

        Ensure that the cookie or user IP address has not changed from the starting page to the `returnUrl` page.

             or a card reader of higher class.
          *  `class2`: The order must be confirmed with a card reader where the PIN code is entered on the reader.

        This condition should always be combined with a `certificatePolicies` for a smart card to avoid undefined

        *  `"1.2.752.60.1.6"` - Test BankID for some BankID banks

        When using one of the _BankID on card_ policies, the `cardReader` requirement can be used to further restrict the
        type of card reader allowed. If no `cardReader` requirement is passed, all supported kinds of card readers are

        This is a base 64 encoded OCSP response.

        The OCSP response is signed by a certificate that has the same issuer as the certificate being verified, and it has
        a nonce extension. The nonce is calculated as:

        *  SHA-1 hash over the base 64 XML signature encoded as UTF-8.
        *  12 random bytes added after the hash.

        The nonce is 32 bytes (20 + 12).
    risk:

        -  `low`: No or low risk identified in the available order data.
        -  `moderate`: Might require further action, investigation or follow-up by you based on the order data.
        -  `high`: The order should be blocked or cancelled by you and needs further action, investigation or follow-up.
           This value will only be returned if you have requested to have the risk assement to be provided, but not
           supplied a `risk` condition.

        This is only returned if requested in the order, and it may be absent if the risk could not be calculated.

        If you have sent the correct `endUserIp` and additional data, a risk indication with the value `"high"` means
        there are signs of the channel binding being compromised, or other highly concerning circumstances.
