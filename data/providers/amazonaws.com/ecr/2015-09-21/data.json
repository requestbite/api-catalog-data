  "description": "<fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Registry</fullname> <p>Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container image registry service. Customers can use the familiar Docker CLI, or their preferred client, to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports private repositories with resource-based permissions using IAM so that specific users or Amazon EC2 instances can access repositories and images.</p> <p>Amazon ECR has service endpoints in each supported Region. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ecr.html\">Amazon ECR endpoints</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>",
