  "description": "The AWS Migration Hub home region APIs are available specifically for working with your Migration Hub home region. You can use these APIs to determine a home region, as well as to create and work with controls that describe the home region.\n\n\n- You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home region, or a `HomeRegionNotSetException` error is returned.\n- API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are permitted outside of your home region.\n- If you call a write API outside the home region, an `InvalidInputException` is returned.\n- You can call `GetHomeRegion` action to obtain the account's Migration Hub home region.  For specific API usage, see the sections that follow in this AWS Migration Hub Home Region API reference.",
