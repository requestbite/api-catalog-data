With MediaTailor, you can assemble existing content into a linear stream and serve targeted ads to viewers while maintaining broadcast quality in over-the-top (OTT) video applications. For information about using the service, including detailed information about the settings covered in this guide, see the [AWS Elemental MediaTailor User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/).\n\nThrough the SDKs and the CLI you manage AWS Elemental MediaTailor configurations and channels the same as you do through the console.
