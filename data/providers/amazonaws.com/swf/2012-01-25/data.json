  "description": "<fullname>Amazon Simple Workflow Service</fullname> <p>The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build applications that use Amazon's cloud to coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a <i>task</i> represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component of your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application.</p> <p>Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining their state.</p> <p>This documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of the Amazon SWF programming model, see the <i> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/\">Amazon SWF Developer Guide</a> </i>.</p>",
