  "description": "AWS Marketplace Metering Service This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace Metering Service API.\n\nAWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom usage dimensions.\n\nFor information on the permissions you need to use this API, see [AWS Marketplace metering and entitlement API permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/iam-user-policy-for-aws-marketplace-actions.html) in the *AWS Marketplace Seller Guide.*\n\n**Submitting Metering Records**\n\n\n-  *MeterUsage* - Submits the metering record for an AWS Marketplace product. `MeterUsage` is called from an EC2 instance or a container running on EKS or ECS.\n-  *BatchMeterUsage* - Submits the metering record for a set of customers. `BatchMeterUsage` is called from a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application.   **Accepting New Customers**\n\n\n-  *ResolveCustomer* - Called by a SaaS application during the registration process. When a buyer visits your website during the registration process, the buyer submits a Registration Token through the browser. The Registration Token is resolved through this API to obtain a `CustomerIdentifier` along with the `CustomerAWSAccountId` and `ProductCode`.   **Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products**\n\n\n- Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the `RegisterUsage` operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call `RegisterUsage`, but you can do so if you want to receive usage data in your seller reports. For more information on using the `RegisterUsage` operation, see [Container-Based Products](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html).    `BatchMeterUsage` API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to verify that the SaaS metering records that you sent are accurate by searching for records with the `eventName` of `BatchMeterUsage`. You can also use CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more information, see the * [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html).*",
