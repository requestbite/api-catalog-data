  "description": "<fullname>Amazon ElastiCache</fullname> <p>Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a distributed cache in the cloud.</p> <p>With ElastiCache, customers get all of the benefits of a high-performance, in-memory cache with less of the administrative burden involved in launching and managing a distributed cache. The service makes setup, scaling, and cluster failure handling much simpler than in a self-managed cache deployment.</p> <p>In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers get enhanced visibility into the key performance statistics associated with their cache and can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.</p>",
