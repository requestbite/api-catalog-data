  "description": "Welcome to the Amazon AppFlow API reference. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the Amazon AppFlow API operations, data types, and errors.\n\nAmazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables you to securely transfer data between software as a service (SaaS) applications like Salesforce, Marketo, Slack, and ServiceNow, and Amazon Web Services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift.\n\nUse the following links to get started on the Amazon AppFlow API:\n\n-  [Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/1.0/APIReference/API_Operations.html): An alphabetical list of all Amazon AppFlow API operations.\n-  [Data types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/1.0/APIReference/API_Types.html): An alphabetical list of all Amazon AppFlow data types.\n-  [Common parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/1.0/APIReference/CommonParameters.html): Parameters that all Query operations can use.\n-  [Common errors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/1.0/APIReference/CommonErrors.html): Client and server errors that all operations can return.  If you're new to Amazon AppFlow, we recommend that you review the [Amazon AppFlow User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/latest/userguide/what-is-appflow.html).\n\nAmazon AppFlow API users can use vendor-specific mechanisms for OAuth, and include applicable OAuth attributes (such as `auth-code` and `redirecturi`) with the connector-specific `ConnectorProfileProperties` when creating a new connector profile using Amazon AppFlow API operations. For example, Salesforce users can refer to the [ *Authorize Apps with OAuth* ](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_authenticate.htm) documentation.",
