  "description": "The Identity Store service used by AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) provides a single place to retrieve all of your identities (users and groups). For more information, see the [IAM Identity Center User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html).\n\n```\n`  Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the `sso` and `identitystore` API namespaces will continue to retain their original name for backward compatibility purposes. For more information, see [IAM Identity Center rename](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed).\n\nThis reference guide describes the identity store operations that you can call programatically and includes detailed information about data types and errors.\n\n`\n```",
