  "description": "Batch Using Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the Amazon Web Services Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. Batch uses the advantages of the batch computing to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch computing software approach. You can use Batch to efficiently provision resources d, and work toward eliminating capacity constraints, reducing your overall compute costs, and delivering results more quickly.\n\nAs a fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific workloads. With Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can focus on analyzing results and solving your specific problems instead.",
