  "description": "**Note:** This is a [ ![Limited Release](/cms/img/docs/partners-api.svg)(Limited Release)](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/versioning.html#limited) API available only to select developers approved by business units.\n\nThe **Logistics API** resources offer the following capabilities:\n- **shipping_quote** &ndash; Consolidates into a list a set of live shipping rates, or quotes, from which you can select a rate to ship a package.\n- **shipment** &ndash; Creates a \"shipment\" for the selected shipping rate. Call **createShippingQuote** to get a list of live shipping rates. The rates returned are all valid for a specific time window and all quoted prices are at eBay-negotiated rates.\n\nSelect one of the live rates and using its associated **rateId**, create a \"shipment\" for the package by calling **createFromShippingQuote**. Creating a shipment completes an agreement, and the cost of the base service and any added shipping options are summed into the returned **totalShippingCost** value. This action also generates a shipping label that you can use to ship the package.  The total cost of the shipment is incurred when the package is shipped using the supplied shipping label.  **Important!** Sellers must set up a payment method via their eBay account before they can use the methods in this API to create a shipment and the associated shipping label.",
