For information on how to obtain access to this API in production, see the [Buy APIs Requirements](api-docs/buy/static/buy-requirements.html).\n\nThe Feed API provides the ability to download TSV_GZIP feed files containing eBay items and an hourly snapshot file of the items that have changed within an hour for a specific category, date and marketplace. In addition to the API, there is an open source [Feed SDK](https://github.com/eBay/FeedSDK ) written in Java that downloads, combines files into a single file when needed, and unzips the entire feed file. It also lets you specify field filters to curate the items in the file.",
