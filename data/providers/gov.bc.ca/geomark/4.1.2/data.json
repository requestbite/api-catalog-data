This service is especially helpful when you need to share an area of interest with people who require that the data be in a different format, or they use different mapping software. \n\nPlease note that you may experience issues when submitting requests to the delivery or test environment if using this [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/bcgov/api-specs/tree/master/geomark) in other API console viewers.",
