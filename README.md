# RequestBite API Catalog

## About

The RequestBite API Catalog is a vast community-built catalog of interesting
REST APIs in a wide range of categories. The catalog itself is served through an
open and publicly available API. You can also browse the catalog online via
Slingshots's [catalog browser](https://s.requestbite.com/catalog).

## State of the catalog

The API and this repository is currently in its infancy, meaning:

* The API format is undergoing active development so there are breaking changes
  happening from time to time. When the format stabilizes we will publish the
  documentation in the catalog itself.

* It will soon be possible to submit your own APIs to the API catalog. This
  requires both instructions, a code of conduct, the actual technical
  implementation, etc, for this to work correctly. While this repository serves as
  the source data of the catalog, adding / editing APIs to it will eventually be
  done through the [Slingshot API client](https://s.requestbite.com).

## Notable mentions

A big thanks to the [APIs.guru](https://apis.guru) project that has been used to
power a large part of the initial version of the catalog.
